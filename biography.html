									<p>
										My overwhelming interest in the Computational Systems has led me to be an Honours B.Sc. student since 2018 in Computer Sceince under supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kFOJzocAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. M.R. Hooshmandasl</a>, and my accomplishments and activities caused to be the Youngest <b>Teaching Assistant</b> in the Department of Computer Science, as well as Department of Mathematics and Applications (Lecturer in Charge: <a href="https://uma.ac.ir/cv.php?cv=127&url_title=Naser-Zamani&mod=scv&rewrite_url=1&mod=scv" target="_blank">Prof. Naser Zamani</a>) and First Undergraduate <b>Research Assistant</b> in Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (Principal Investigator: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lbyFwZkAAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Shahram Jamali</a>) at University of Mohaghegh Ardabili (UMA). I was a <b>Content Creator</b> at Sharif University of Technology's (SUT) Iranian Society of Cryptology (Scientific Secretary: <a href="http://sharif.edu/~teghlidos/" target="_blank">Dr. Taraneh Eghlidos</a>). Before entering UMA, I earned my Diploma in Mathematical Sciences from Ayatollah Malakouti Elite High School in East Azerbaijan.
										</br>
										Apart from academia, as a B.Sc. student I have passed multiple extra courses with a focus on industrial aspects: <b>Network Security Engineering</b> (2021), Huawei Technologies; <b>Innovation Practice of IoT</b> (2021), Shanghai Jiao Tong University; <b>Engineering and Innovation</b> (2021), Nordic Science Centre Association; <b>Advanced Information Security</b> (2021), The Open University; <b>Information Security Architecture</b> (2020), eQual Assurance; <b>Web Development</b> (2019), Oxford Cert.

												<h3>Personal</h3>
												<p><i>"Avoiding uniform life and rushing into adventures!".</i> I think that my mind is summed up in three traits: Competitive, Hasty, and Eager for Science. I am a melomaniac, so listening to different types of music is really delightful for me. Other parts of my hobbies are watching scientific documentaries [<a target="_blank" href="https://gallery-and-notes.github.io/images/Scientific Documentaries.jpg">Favorites</a>] about Quantum Physics, Biology and Psychology, and playing video games [<a target="_blank" href="https://gallery-and-notes.github.io/images/Video Games.jpg">Favorites</a>].</p>

											<h3>Skills</h3>
											<p>I spent some time getting familiar with <b>Full-Stack Development</b> and <b>Information Security Engineering</b>. In developing the web applications, I mostly got interested in the MEVN stack (Vue.js, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB), along with React Native for developing cross-platform mobile applications. Also, penetration testing for the Networks, Web, and Android applications is one of the most exacting things for me, and I am always trying to keep myself involved with them. Furthermore, I never limit myself to a special set of programming languages and operating systems, and I switch among technologies based on my project's needs. Professional <b>Film Editing</b> (Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere Pro) and working with <b>Digital Audio Workstations</b> (Adobe Audition) are skills that I gained by getting involved in my free time for a long time.</p>
